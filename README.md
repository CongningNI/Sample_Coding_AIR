# Sample Coding for AIR Doctorate Internship

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the AIR Doctorate Internship coding skill sample project. This repository contains a collection of notebooks and scripts demonstrating various data science and machine learning methodologies, specifically focusing on data preprocessing, topic modeling, LSTM neural networks, and structural topic modeling applied to Alzheimer's research.

## Files Overview

### 1. [Data Preprocessing Sample.ipynb](Data%20Preprocessing%20Sample.ipynb)
This Jupyter notebook details steps for effective data preprocessing, including data aggregation, cleaning, and basic model evaluation. It demonstrates the use of pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for handling and visualizing data, setting a foundation for any machine learning project.

### 2. [Topic Modeling.ipynb](Topic%20Modeling.ipynb)
A comprehensive guide to topic modeling, this notebook employs libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib to prepare, process, and visualize data for uncovering hidden thematic structures in large text corpora.

### 3. [Machine Learning Sample - LSTM.ipynb](Machine%20Learning%20Sample%20-%20LSTM.ipynb)
This notebook explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for natural language processing tasks, showcasing text preprocessing, model construction, and evaluation with libraries including NLTK, TensorFlow, Keras, and sklearn.

### 4. [stm_alz.Rmd](stm_alz.Rmd)
An R Markdown document focused on structural topic modeling within the context of Alzheimer's research. It demonstrates the use of the `stm` package for topic modeling, along with `tm`, `furrr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyverse` for text mining, data manipulation, and visualization.

## Getting Started
